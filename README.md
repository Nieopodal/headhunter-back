# About The Project

![screenshot of the app](https://i.ibb.co/mSzmTB6/browser-mockup.png)

MegaK HeadHunter is a project made by participants of a Polish webdev course called [MegaKurs](https://megak.pl). It was a team-based (agile/scrum) effort, that was assigned as a final project.

MegaK HeadHunter is an IT employment-focused platform, which allows the students, who have completed the abovementioned course, to apply for their first jobs. It allows head hunters from various companies to browse each sudent's CV's and appoint interviews.

* NodeJs [![nodejs][nodejs]][nodejs-url]
* NestJS [![NestJS][NestJS]][NestJs-url]
* Typescript [![typescript][typescript]][typescript-url]
* mySQL [![mySQL][mySQL]][mySQL-url]

### Install locally
To install HeadHunter app locally:

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Nieopodal/headhunter-back.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. run npm start
   ```sh
   npm run start:dev
   or
   nest start --watch
   ```

### Set up your env file
To configure this backend server correctly, edit the appropriate fields of the .env file, such as the app running port, your mailer config, SQL database connection details, or CORS settings for the frontend client. The template for this file is in the code (`env-example`)

Also, take a look a the TypeORM config file
(`src/config/typeorm.config.ts`) and make sure you have synchronization turned on, so that TypeORM can populate your database with the right tables. 

```
{...
synchronize: true,
...}
```

After that, it is advised to turn this setting off.
